# Mapping Earthquakes
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to make interactive maps to display earthquake data including magnitude and locaiton for earthquakes that have occured within the past 7 days. By adding interactivity to the map, the user will be able to toggle between selections depending on the information they want the map to display. Features on the maps include circle markers displayed where the earthquake has taken place and the radius and color of the marker is dependent on the magnitude of the earthquake. The map also provides a legend for the user to reference to know what the color scale for the magnitudes represents. Users also have the ability to display tectonic plate data on the maps. This allows the user to see the location of the earthquake in relation to the tectonic plates. To create these maps, data from the US Geological Survey website was utilized in the form of GeoJSON data to be read into the javascript files. All of the features collectively displayed on the map provide interactivity for the user and allows them to view data in the format of their choosing and how many features they want to view on the map at once.

Various features added to the maps in this analysis can be seen below:
